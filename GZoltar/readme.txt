INSTALLATION OF GZOLTAR ON ECLIPSE WITH PROVIDED PLUG-IN
==========================================================

First of all thanks for your interest in the GZoltar toolset. There are two steps in order to install GZoltar:

1 - Install the plugin using the link http://www.gzoltar.com/web/plugin. Just go to Eclipse->Help->Install New Software.

2 - After the first stage, we advise you to watch the videos in order to understand how GZoltar works. The videos can be found online at http://www.youtube.com/user/GZoltarDebugging.



This is an academic version, and we are still improving the toolset. Your feedback is rather valuable. Please accept our invitation and fill an evaluation questionnaire which is online at http://goo.gl/vNBbx.
However, you can use a standalone version of the GZoltar tool. At http://gzoltar.com/lib/ you can find a jar file with the core of the GZoltar. And at http://gzoltar.com/api/ is the JavaDoc of that lib.

ENJOY !
